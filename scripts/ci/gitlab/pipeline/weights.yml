  # The update-weights pipeline defaults to `interruptible: false` so that we'll be able to
  # reach and run the benchmarking jobs despite the "Auto-cancel redundant pipelines" CI setting.
  # The setting is relevant because future pipelines (e.g. created for new commits or other schedules)
  # might otherwise cancel the benchmark jobs early.
